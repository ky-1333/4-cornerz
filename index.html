    <p><h5>The object that I have selected and the the artifact, are both linked by numbers, aesthetics and purpos. My object is an image with 4 people in them, one being me and three of my other closest friends. The artifact is a basket with 4 stands on the bottom. The numbers corrolate to the number of people in the picture. If one of them is not there, then the basket i unstable. I interpret the stands as trust from each of us.</h5></p>
     <p><h5>Before I came to the museum, I thought it would bee boring because it was just a museum. However as we walked around and explored more of it I was more engaged with the artifacts and the the history behind them, especially the Korean room.</h5></p>
